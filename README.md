# Official Flutter packages for [Stream Activity Feeds](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/?=utm_medium=stream_github&utm_source=flutter_feeds)

>The official Dart client for Stream Activity Feeds, a service for building activity feed applications. This library can be used on any Dart project and on both mobile and web apps with Flutter. You can sign up for a Stream account at https://getstream.io/get_started.


Note: The user interface for the activity feed can vary widely across different apps. Most of our activity feed customers integrate with Stream via their backend and build their own UI. This takes advantage of Stream’s scalability while keeping full control over the UI. We update this library but not as frequently as other SDKs.

## 🛠 Installation

#### Install from pub

Next step is to add `stream_feed` to your dependencies, to do that just open pubspec.yaml and add it inside the dependencies section.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  stream_feed: ^[latest-version]
```
#### Using with Flutter

This package can be integrated into Flutter applications. Remember to not expose the App Secret in your Flutter web apps, mobile apps, or other non-trusted environments like desktop apps.

## 🔌 Usage

### API client setup Serverside + Clientside

If you want to use the API client directly on your web/mobile app you need to generate a user token server-side and pass it.

#### Server-side token generation

```dart

// Instantiate a new client (server side)
const apiKey = 'my-API-key';
const secret = 'my-API-secret';

// Instantiate a new client (server side)
var client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey, secret: secret);

// Optionally supply the app identifier and an options object specifying the data center to use and timeout for requests (15s)
client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey,
      secret: secret,
      appId: 'yourappid',
      options: StreamHttpClientOptions(
          location: Location.usEast, connectTimeout: Duration(seconds: 15)));

// Create a token for user with id "the-user-id"
final userToken = client.frontendToken('the-user-id');
```

> :warning: for security, you must never expose your API secret or generated client side token, and it's highly recommended to use `exp` claim in client side token.


#### Client API init

```dart
// Instantiate new client with a user token
var client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey, token: Token('userToken'));
```

### 🔮 Examples

```dart
// Instantiate a feed object server side
var user1 = client.flatFeed('user', '1');

// Get activities from 5 to 10 (slow pagination)
final activities = await user1.getActivities(limit: 5, offset: 5);
// Filter on an id less than a given UUID
final filtered_activities = await user1.getActivities(
      limit: 5,
      filter: Filter().idLessThan('e561de8f-00f1-11e4-b400-0cc47a024be0')

// All API calls are performed asynchronous and return a Promise object
await user1
    .getActivities(
        limit: 5,
        filter: Filter().idLessThan('e561de8f-00f1-11e4-b400-0cc47a024be0'))
    .then((value) => /* on success */
        print(value))
    .onError((error,
              stackTrace) => /* on failure, reason.error contains an explanation */
        print(error));

// Create a new activity
final activity = Activity( actor: '1', verb: 'tweet', object: '1', foreignId: 'tweet:1' );
final added_activity = await user1.addActivity(activity);
// Create a bit more complex activity
final complex_activity = Activity(
    actor: '1',
    verb: 'run',
    object: '1',
    foreignId: 'run:1',
    extraData: {
      'course': {'name': 'Golden Gate park', 'distance': 10},
      'participants': ['Thierry', 'Tommaso'],
      'started_at': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    },
  );
final added_complex_activity = await user1.addActivity(complex_activity);

// Remove an activity by its id
await user1.removeActivityById('e561de8f-00f1-11e4-b400-0cc47a024be0');
// or remove by the foreign id
await user1.removeActivityByForeignId('tweet:1');

// mark a notification feed as read
await notification1.getActivities(
  marker: ActivityMarker().allRead(),
);


// mark a notification feed as seen
await notification1.getActivities(
  marker: ActivityMarker().allSeen(),
);

// Follow another feed
await user1.follow(client.flatFeed('flat', '42'));

// Stop following another feed
await user1.unfollow(client.flatFeed('flat', '42'));

// Stop following another feed while keeping previously published activities
// from that feed
await user1.unfollow(client.flatFeed('flat', '42'), keepHistory: true);

// Follow another feed without copying the history
await user1.follow(client.flatFeed('flat', '42'), activityCopyLimit: 0);

// List followers, following
await user1.getFollowers(limit: 10, offset: 10);
await user1.getFollowed(limit: 10, offset: 0);


await user1.follow(client.flatFeed('flat', '42'));

// adding multiple activities
const activities = [
  Activity(actor: '1', verb: 'tweet', object: '1'),
  Activity(actor: '2', verb: 'tweet', object: '3'),
];
await user1.addActivities(activities);

// specifying additional feeds to push the activity to using the to param
// especially useful for notification style feeds
final to = FeedId.fromIds(['user:2', 'user:3']);
final activityTo = Activity(
  to: to,
  actor: '1',
  verb: 'tweet',
  object: '1',
  foreignId: 'tweet:1',
);
await user1.addActivity(activityTo);


// adding one activity to multiple feeds
final feeds = FeedId.fromIds(['flat:1', 'flat:2', 'flat:3', 'flat:4']);
final activityTarget = Activity(
  actor: 'User:2',
  verb: 'pin',
  object: 'Place:42',
  target: 'Board:1',
);

// ⚠️ server-side only!
await client.batch.addToMany(activityTarget, feeds!);

// Batch create follow relations (let flat:1 follow user:1, user:2 and user:3 feeds in one single request)
const follows = [
  FollowRelation(source: 'flat:1', target: 'user:1'),
  FollowRelation(source:'flat:1', target: 'user:2'),
  FollowRelation(source:'flat:1', target: 'user:3'),
];

// ⚠️ server-side only!
await client.batch.followMany(follows);

// Updating parts of an activity
final set = {
  'product.price': 19.99,
  shares: {
    facebook: '...',
    twitter: '...',
  },
};
final unset = ['daily_likes', 'popularity'];

// ...by ID
final update = ActivityUpdate.withId( '54a60c1e-4ee3-494b-a1e3-50c06acb5ed4', set, unset);
await client.updateActivityById(update);
// ...or by combination of foreign ID and time
const timestamp = DateTime.now();
const foreignID= 'product:123';
final update2 = ActivityUpdate.withForeignId(
  foreignID,
  timestamp,
  set,
  unset,
);
await client.updateActivityById(update2);


// update the 'to' fields on an existing activity
// client.flatFeed("user", "ken").function (foreign_id, timestamp, new_targets, added_targets, removed_targets)
// new_targets, added_targets, and removed_targets are all arrays of feed IDs
// either provide only the `new_targets` parameter (will replace all targets on the activity),
// OR provide the added_targets and removed_targets parameters
// NOTE - the updateActivityToTargets method is not intended to be used in a browser environment.
await client.flatFeed('user', 'ken').updateActivityToTargets('foreign_id:1234', timestamp, ['feed:1234']);
await client.flatFeed('user', 'ken').updateActivityToTargets('foreign_id:1234', timestamp, null, ['feed:1234']);
await client.flatFeed('user', 'ken').updateActivityToTargets('foreign_id:1234', timestamp, null, null, ['feed:1234']);
```

### Realtime (Faye)

Stream uses [Faye](https://faye.jcoglan.com) for realtime notifications. Below is quick guide to subscribing to feed changes

```dart

// ⚠️ userToken is generated server-side (see previous section)
final client = StreamFeedClient('YOUR_API_KEY', token: userToken,appId: 'APP_ID');
final user1 = client.flatFeed('user', '1');

// subscribe to the changes
final subscription = await userFeed.subscribe((message) => print(message));
// now whenever something changes to the feed user 1
// the callback will be called

// To cancel a subscription you can call cancel on the
// object returned from a subscribe call.
// This will remove the listener from this channel.
await subscription.cancel();
```

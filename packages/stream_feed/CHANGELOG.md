## 0.5.2: 30/03/2022

- fix(serverside llc): `issueJwtHS256` wasn't using the `expiresAt` field and remove the default "exp" value.
- new: pagination suuport for flat feed activities. For example:
```dart
final paginated = await flatFeed.paginatedActivities();
final nextParams = parseNext(paginated.next!);
// parse next page
await flatFeed.paginatedActivities(limit: nextParams.limit,filter: nextParams.idLT);
```

## 0.5.1+1: 24/03/2022

- fix: the `JsonConverter<DateTime,String>` implemented in 0.4.0+1 that was supposed to handle utc dates parsing wasn't working properly. Now that it is actually fixed you can convert dates in the user's local timezone.
- depedencies bumps
  
## 0.5.1: 12/01/2022

- upstream(realtime): version bump. You can now listen to connexion status in the `Subscription` class. For example:
  
```dart
final subscription = await feed.subscribe();
final subscriptionStatus = subscription.stateStream;
```
- new(realtime): you can now adjust log level when subscribing
- fix: implement Equatable on `StreamFeedClient`. With this change, if you fetch your client from an `InheritedWidget` for example, `updateShouldNotify` doesn't trigger every time.


## 0.5.0: 12/01/2022

- BREAKING: we no longer accept a token in the constructor. This change is inspired by Stream Chat, and allows for use cases like multi account management. It allows to instantiate `StreamFeedClient` at the top of your widget tree for example, and connecting the user later.
  
```diff
-  client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey, token: frontendToken);
+  client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey);
+
+  await client.setUser(
+    const User(
+      data: {
+        'name': 'John Doe',
+        'occupation': 'Software Engineer',
+        'gender': 'male'
+      },
+    ),
+    frontendToken,
+  );
```


## 0.4.0+3: 27/12/2021

- fix: call profile in setUser, so that currentUser data is not null


## 0.4.0+2: 22/12/2021

- fix: export image_storage_client.dart


## 0.4.0+1: 07/12/2021

- fix: support null values `extraData`'s map
- fix: utc date parsing with a `JsonConverter<DateTime,String>` and `intl`
- fix: unread/unseen count in `NotificationFeedMeta` model


## 0.4.0: 29/10/2021

- breaking: `StreamFeedClient.connect` is now `StreamFeedClient` for better user session handling.
The connect verb was confusing, and made you think that it will perform the connection immediately. Also it doesn't infer the id anymore from the token anymore. You can now have to call `setUser` down the tree or before `runApp`
- breaking: `setUser` now takes a `User` (must contain id) and a token. Passing the userToken in client constructor was making the whole instance depend on a single user.
- new: we support generics
`EnrichedActivity` is now `GenericEnrichedActivity<A,Ob,T,Or>` in order to have a more flexible API surface. Those generic parameters can be as follows:
A = [actor]: can be an User, String
Ob = [object] can a String, or a CollectionEntry
T = [target] can be a String or an Activity
Or = [origin] can be a String or a Reaction or an User
- breaking: along with these changes we removed `EnrichableField` field from `EnrichedActivity` 
- new: there is a type definition `EnrichedActivity` to handle most use cases of `GenericEnrichedActivity` (User,String,String,String)
- fix: a time drift issue in token generation when using the low level client sever-side
- bump: dart sdk package constraints to 2.14 to make use of typedefs for non function types

- new: serverside methods for CRUD operations on User(getUser, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser)
- new: `CancelToken`, `OnSendProgress` named parameters to support cancelling an upload and tracking its progress
- new: logger options to allow choosing the Logger level
- fix: missing field `ownChildren` in `Reaction` model

//TODO: mark this as immutable maybe?
/// Enrichment is a concept in Stream that enables our API to work quickly
/// and efficiently.
///
/// It is the concept that most data is stored as references to an original
/// data. For example, if I add an activity to my feed and it fans out to 50
/// followers, the activity is not copied 50 times, but the activity is stored
/// in a single table only once, and references are stored in 51 feeds.
///
/// The same rule applies to users and reactions. They are stored only once,
/// but references are used elsewhere.
///
/// An Enriched Activity is an Activity with additional fields
/// that are derived from the Activity's
///
/// This class makes use of generics in order to have a more flexible API
/// surface. Here is a legend of what each generic is for:
/// * A = [actor]
/// * Ob = [object]
/// * T = [target]
/// * Or = [origin]
